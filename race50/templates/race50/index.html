            Karting is more than speed — it’s a battle of precision, consistency, and constant progress. Every lap tells 
            a story, and every story has lessons hidden in the data. Race50 is built to help you uncover those lessons. 
            With just a few clicks, you can transform raw telemetry into clear, powerful insights that reveal where you’re 
            gaining time, where you’re losing it, and what changes will make you faster. <br>

            Upload your sessions to see detailed breakdowns of laps and sectors. Compare different runs side by side to 
            spot patterns in your driving. Discover your theoretical best lap, and understand how close you are to 
            reaching your full potential. From highlighting your strongest corners to pointing out the small 
            inconsistencies that cost you tenths, Race50 turns every bit of data into knowledge you can use. <br>

            Karting isn’t just about being quick today — it’s about building towards tomorrow. Whether you’re preparing 
            for your first race weekend or pushing for a championship, Race50 gives you the tools to grow as a driver. 
            With every analysis, you’ll gain more confidence, sharpen your skills, and develop the consistency that wins 
            races. <br>

            Race50 is not just a platform — it’s your racing companion, built to guide you from one lap to the next, 
            showing you the path toward improvement. Every upload is an opportunity, every comparison a new 
            perspective, every session a step closer to your best. <br>
